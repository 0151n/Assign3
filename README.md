# Assignment 3

## Repository for group 2's code for assignment 3
---
## Design

## Todo

 1. use struct with vla and single int for size for single polynomial
 2. write specs for each operation [seven steps pg 11](https://sulis.ul.ie/access/content/group/1008ce87-d89a-4410-bb59-16f92bc4d1ce/Unit%202%20-%20Software%20Development%20Practices%20and%20Tools/CE4703-2018-Unit02-SWDevelopmentPracticesTools.pdf)
 3. make out function declarations
 4. write out psuedocode algorithm for each operation
 5. implement operations
 6. create test main function (human input not required)
 7. make file (one variable, clean target, comipile/link/run when no target given)


### Functions needed

 Required functions:

 1. create a polynomial
 2. delete a polynomial
 3. add two polynomials
 4. subtract two polynimials
 5. multiply two polynomials
 6. divide two polynomials
 7. normalise a polynomial
 8. get order of a polynomial
 9. print polynomial

 Extra functions:

 1. divide whole polynomial by a scalar (useful for required function 7)
 2. plot polynomial to stdout :^)
 3. ????
 4. profit
