Create a new data structure to hold a polynomial in memory

name: make_poly
parameters: size

psuedocode
----------
	Allocate a block of memory of size (size of the struct) + size * (size of a single double)
	Check that the memory was allocated and return NULL if it wasn't
	set the size element of the struct to the inputed size
	for each element in the structs coefficient array
		set coefficient to 0
	return pointer to new polynomial struct


------------------------------------------

Function: Create a polynomial

name: create_poly
parameters: size, coefficents

psuedocode
----------

	define a new poly in memory using make_poly function
	for each element in the new poly's coefficient array
		set coefficient to corresponding coefficient in input coefficient array
	return pointer to new polynomial in memory


------------------------------------------

Function: Delete a polynimial from memory

name: delete_poly
parameters: size,coefficients

psuedocode
----------

	Delete structure from memory using free() function
